Banzhaf power index is a power index defined by the probability of changing an outcome of a vote where voting rights are not necessarily equally divided among 
the voters or shareholders. To calculate the power of a voter using the Banzhaf index, list all the winning coalitions, then count the critical voters. A critical 
voter is a voter who, if he changed his vote from yes to no, would cause the measure to fail. [Source: Wikipedia]
